	<li><b>"Where?" said the pig. </b></li>

	<li><b>The wolf was very angry and declared that he would eat the little pig and that he would go down the chimney to do so. When the little pig saw this, he used a pot of water and made a blazing fire. Just as the wolf was coming down, the pig took off the cover and in an instant, boiled him up and ate him for supper. And he lived happily ever after.</b></li>
