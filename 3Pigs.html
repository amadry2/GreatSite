	<h1>THE THREE<br>LITTLE PIGS</h1>
	<h3>by: James Halliwell-Phillipps</h3>
	<h5>Once upon a time there were three little pigs. The time came for them to leave home and seek <a href="3Pigs_Page_2.html">their fortunes</a>. Before they left, their mother told them "Whatever you do, do it the best that you can because that's the way to get along in the world."</h5>
