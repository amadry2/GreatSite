			Super Mario may be a best seller now, but back then it had plenty of competitiion to take down. One of the most notable is the blue blur himself, Sonic the Hedgehog! This franchise is Sega's most popular and beloved due to its fast paced gameplay and its well liked characters such as Shadow the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Sonic himself, and more. Having fast-paced games was something revolutionary at the time when the franchise was first being concieved and Sega showed that they can still produce good Sonic games with new releases such as Sonic Mania, Sonic Colours, and more!
