			Capcom’s lineup of games is very rich and is one of the few companies that rival Nintendo’s franchises with how iconic they are. While there are many titles, such as the infamous Ghosts n Goblins, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter, their most iconic and arguably mascot of their company is the blue bomber, Mega Man. Ever since coming out in 1987, the blue bomber has been in so many games with the newest release being Mega Man 11. Not only does he have his main series of games, but he also hosts a plethora of spin off games as well, such as the Mega Man X series, the Mega Man Battle Network series, Mega Man Legends series, and so much more. This blue hero is one that will never be forgotten no matter how many generations go by.
