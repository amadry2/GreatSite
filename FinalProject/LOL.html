			Branching off from 2 different teams, while one team was making DOTA 2, the other worked on what was to be one of the most popular MMO’s yet, League of Legends. This was one of Riot Games’ best decisions as the future of this game was bright, making it into E-sports and becoming a sensation among many gamers, some even making a living off this one game. It truly is a title that transcended just being a video game that people play casually.
