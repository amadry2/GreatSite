			From the Destiny franchise to the Marathon franchise, Bungie Inc. has created many different titles throughout the years ever since it was picked up in 1990. However, the company is most known for creating then Halo franchise, a sci-fi series involving Master Chief the space warrior, and his journey through the Sol system. A large portion of Bungieâ€™s game lineup consists of game from this franchise and is very popular among gamer, so much so that Master Chief is up there with other gaming icons such as Mario, Sonic, and others as well (which is impressive considering that Halo: Combat Evolved came out in 2001). The series sells extremely well and is highly regarded among many.
